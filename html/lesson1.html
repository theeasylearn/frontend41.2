        <b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star, </b><br>
        How I wonder what you are! <br>
        Up above the world so high, <br>
        Like a diamond in the sky. <br>
         
        <b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</b> <br>
        How I wonder what you are! <br>
         
        **When the blazing sun is gone,** <br>
        When he nothing shines upon, <br>
        Then you show your little light,<br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>  <br>
        
        <u><b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</b></u>  <br>
        How I wonder what you are!  <br>
        
        **Then the traveler in the dark**  <br>
        Thanks you for your tiny spark;  <br>
        He could not see which way to go,  <br>
        If you did not twinkle so.  <br>
        
        <i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>  <br>
        How I wonder what you are!  <br>
        
        **In the dark blue sky you keep,**  <br>
        And often through my curtains peep,  <br>
        For you never shut your eye  <br>
        Till the sun is in the sky.  <br>
        
        **Twinkle, twinkle, little star,**  <br>
        How I wonder what you are!  <br>
        
        **As your bright and tiny spark**  <br>
        Lights the traveler in the dark,  <br>
        Though I know not what you are,  <br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star.  <br>
        
        **Twinkle, twinkle, little star,**  <br>
        How I wonder what you are!  <br>
